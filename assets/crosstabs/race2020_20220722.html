<p class="crosstext">
The publication of 2020 Census data has changed the way that Race and Hispanic Origin categories are represented.  
The Census Bureau has worked hard to expand the information to code responses to the Race and Hispanic Origin questions on the Census form.  
These changes resulted in an increase in the number of persons classifying themselves as “multi-racial”, i.e., the number of people who identify with more than one Race

<p class="crosstext">
The State Demography Office publishes Colorado estimates of race and ethnic groups by sex and age and produced a new data series reflecting the categories used by the Census Bureau.  These revisions require a break in the data series, meaning that the categories used in the 2010-2020 data series (a series benchmarked to the 2010 Census) 
are not fully comparable with the categories benchmarked to the 2020 Census.  
Two notable changes are the separation of the “Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander” and "Asian" categories from the “Asian/Pacific Islander" category and the addition of a “Two or More Races” category in the data tools and spreadsheets published on the State Demography Office website.

</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The major changes in the 2020 Decennial Census data are grounded in questionnaire and data processing changes.  For example, the 2020 Decennial Census form allowed for an open-ended response box for each racial and Hispanic Origin category.  
This allowed respondents to enter information about their ancestry.  Unlike previous Census processing, the Census Bureau has taken additional effort to recover and code these open-ended responses to create a more 
accurate tabulation of respondents’ Race and Hispanic Origin.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The addition of the new racial categories and the changes in processing limit the comparability of the 2020 Census data with previous data series.  This means that Colorado’s current population estimate series, which is based on the 2020 Decennial Census data, 
should not be compared to previous estimate series, which have been based on the 2010 and earlier censuses.  While SDO will continue to update our estimate series annually, some of the differences between the 2020 and 2021 estimates and previous estimates, such as the 2019 and 2020 estimate based on the 2010 Census, 
will reflect differences in the processing of the 2020 Census and not necessarily reflect changes in the population.
