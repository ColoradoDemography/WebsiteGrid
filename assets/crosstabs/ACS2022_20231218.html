<h3 class="h3_style">Introduction</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
On December 7th, the Census Bureau released the 2018-2022 American Community Survey. 
This dataset contains population characteristics for census block groups, census tracts, municipalities, counties, and states. 
This data provides a rich picture of Colorado educational attainment, income, housing, and work location, among other social characteristics. 
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
It is important to note the ACS 5-year estimates are not designed to measure rapid change during short periods because the data come from a 5-year period. 
The most appropriate comparison for the 2018-2022 ACS release is the 2013-2017 ACS or prior years as they do not include overlapping years. 
Dollar values are in real or inflation adjusted values for the last year of the 5 year series (2022 for the 2018-2022 series)
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The ACS 5-year data SHOULD NOT be used for total population estimates since it is based on 5 years of data. 
Please visit the <a href="https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/" title="State Demography Office Homepage" aria-label="State Demography Office Homepage">State Demography Office Homepage</a>
for population estimates and forecasts.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The ACS provides over 1,400 tables containing information about the characteristics and conditions of the population ranging from place of birth, 
geographic mobility, transportation, commuting and educational attainment. To view the ACS list of tables and variables as well as several common 
tables collected by the Colorado State Demography Office please visit the State Demography Office ACS Page.
