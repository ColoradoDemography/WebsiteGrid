On January 28, 2024, Nancy Gedeon, Estimates Demographer from the State Demography Office, discussed the growth in the population age 65 and over on 
<a href='https://kosi101.com/shows/no-copay-radio/' target='_blank' title='No Copay Radio" aria-label='No Copay Radio'>No Copay Radio</a>
, which airs on KOSI 101.1 each Sunday.    No Copay Radio is hosted by Murphy Hudson of KOSI and Jayla Sanchez-Warren of the Denver Regional Council of Governments Area Agency on Aging.

The State Demography Office vintage 2022 projections show that Colorado's population will increase by 10 percent between 2020 and 2030. 
Over 50 percent of the population growth by the year 2030 is expected to be over age 65.  
This increase is due to the Colorado's population aging in place, which will have impacts on jobs, housing, and service needs.

<p class="crosstext">
The population 65 years and over is expected to grow 36 percent during this time period, which is an increase of nearly 317,000 older adults by the year 2030.  
Of this population change, 70 percent will be 75 years and over, making the 75 years and over population 8.6 percent of the state's total in 2030, up from 5.7 percent in 2020.  
Because Colorado historically has not attracted a net gain of older adults to the state, the growth in this age group is due to the aging of Colorado's existing population.  
This is expected to have an impact on the labor force as the number of people retiring increases but the growth in the population age 18 to 64 is smaller.
