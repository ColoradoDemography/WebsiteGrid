<h3 class="h3_style">Introduction</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
On December 12, 2025, the Census Bureau released the 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS). 
This dataset contains population characteristics for Census block groups, census tracts, municipalities, counties, and states. 
This data provides a rich picture of Colorado educational attainment, income, housing, and work location, among other social characteristics.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
It is important to note the ACS 5-year estimates are not designed to measure rapid change during short periods because the data come from a 5-year period. 
The most appropriate comparison for the 2019-2023 ACS release is the 2014-2018 ACS or prior years as they do not include overlapping years. 
Dollar values are in real (inflation-adjusted) values for the last year of the 5-year series (for example, all data in the 2019-2023 series are in 2023 dollars).
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The ACS 5-year data SHOULD NOT be used for total population estimates since it is based on 5 years of data.

The State Demography Office has compiled a set of 67 spreadsheets covering common data requests for information about counties, municipalities, and 
Census Designated Places (i.e., unincorporated towns and settlements recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau).  
The ACS 2019-2023 list of spreadsheets includes new compilations for language spoken at home, commuting, and personal ancestry.

<h3 class="h3_style">Income and Poverty</h3>
<h4 class="h4_style">State Results</h4>
<p class="crosstext">
<ul>
<li>Median household income increased between the 2014-2018 ACS and the 2019-2023 ACS. 
In inflation-adjusted dollars, median household income increased from $83,763 to $92,740. </li>
<li>The percentage of people in poverty fell between the 2014-2018 ACS and 2019-2023 ACS.  
The number of people with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level in the 2014-2018 ACS was 591,000, or 10.9 percent, while it was 534,000, or 
9.4 percent in the 2019-2023 ACS.
</li>
<li>The number of people with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level in the 2014-2018 ACS was 1.4 million or 26.5 percent, 
while it was 1.3 million, or 22.5 percent in the 2019-2023 ACS. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
The ACS 5-year data does not provide much detail about the pattern of change in the poverty rate.  
Looking at the ACS 1-year data for Colorado between 2014 and 2023, the percentage of people with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level varied 
between 12.0 percent in 2014 to 9.3 percent in 2023.  With the exception of 2021, which reflected the poverty level during COVID-19 pandemic and recession, 
the percentage of people with incomes below the poverty level shows a gradual decline.
