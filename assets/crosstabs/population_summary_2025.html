<h3 class='crosshead'>2023 Population Summary January 2025</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
In July of 2023, Colorado's resident population was 5,876,300.  The United States population reached 334,914,895, an increase of 1.6 million over the year or a growth rate of 0.5%.  
Colorado ranked 21st in size in the U.S.  Colorado's population increased by 36,100 from July 2022 to July 2023 or 0.6%, ranking Colorado 9th in total change and 18th in percentage change.  
This growth is slightly higher than in 2022 and significantly slower than the 74,000 annual average during the previous decade. 
</p>

<div class="crosstab_content_row">
<h3 class='crosshead'>Colorado's Components of Change</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
Colorado's total growth in 2023 consisted of 62,000 births and 45,200 deaths, resulting in a natural increase of 16,900 and 19,000 in net migration. 
Annual births saw an decrease of about 300 from the previous year, while annual deaths fell by nearly 4,500.  This changes reflects a return to pre-COVID 19 patterns. 
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
Births continued to be lower than historical trends in 2023 but were holding steady. 
The slowing in births will continue to have long-run impacts on K-12 and higher education, as well as the labor force. 
The birth rate differs in each Colorado county. Most counties reached their peak births in 2007, but some counties, like Jefferson, reached their peak births in 2000. 
Weld is the only Front Range county that is continuing to see an increase in births. Births for the state are forecast to increase slightly in 2023 and 2024 as the number of women of childbearing age increases in the state. 
Additionally, the largest group of millennials are entering their 30s, which contributes to increased birth rates. 
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
Over time, the number of deaths in Colorado has increased, reflecting an increased number of older adults. 
COVID-19 caused an additional increase in deaths in 2020, 2021, and 2022. In 2023, deaths reached 45,300, an estimated 4,000 fewer than in 2022. 
Forecasts for 2024 have deaths slowing to 44,000 but still higher than the 39,000 in 2019.
</p>
<p class="crosstext"> 
Net migration accounted for 19,172 of the growth in the state.  
This was slightly higher than in 2022 but significantly lower than the 45,000 annual average during the 2010s.
International migration was estimated at 12,000, returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
The late 2023 arrival of refugees and international migrants will not count in population estimates until 2024 since they occurred after July 1st.  
Domestic migration was estimated at 7,100, up slightly from 2022 but significantly slower than the annual average of 38,000 last decade.

<h3 class='crosshead'>Change by County</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
More U.S. counties experienced population gains than losses in 2023, as counties in the South saw faster growth and more Northeast and Midwest counties had population losses turn to gains.  
Approximately 60% (1,876) of U.S. counties gained population from 2022 to 2023, an increase from the 52% of counties (1,649) that experienced population growth between 2021 and 2022.  
Areas that experienced high levels of domestic out-migration during the pandemic, such as the Midwest and Northeast, are now seeing more counties with population growth. 
Meanwhile, county population growth is slowing down in the west.  
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
In Colorado, 23 of the 64 counties, or 36%, declined. Twenty-four counties experienced net-out migration, led by Arapahoe, Eagle, and Boulder.  
Thirty-five of the sixty-four counties are in a phase of natural decline â€“ meaning there were more deaths than births.  
Most of the counties in a phase of natural decline were in the non-metro parts of the state, where estimated population losses ranged between 2 and 500 people.  
However, the metro counties of Pueblo and Mesa lead the list of counties in natural decline. El Paso, Adams, and Denver counties saw the largest natural increase, between 148 and 731 people.
