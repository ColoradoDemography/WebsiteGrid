Colorado’s universities and colleges provide students with skills and knowledge to succeed in the labor market. 
Understanding the migration patterns of recent college graduates is important to understanding Colorado’s competitiveness, as the question becomes to what extent
are the skills gained by Colorado graduates benefitting the Colorado economy?   
A recent analysis seeks to understand the migration patterns of graduates from Colorado higher education institutions in the first year after they receive a bachelor’s degree.  
Understanding the initial migration patterns of college graduates trained in Colorado informs our understanding of the larger labor market.

The information used to analyze the different places college graduates migrate to from three cohorts of Colorado graduates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) dataset (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). 
With help from different universities, university systems, State Departments of Education, State Labor Market Information offices, the U.S. Census Bureau the PSEO dataset tracks the migration, 
employment history and earnings of college graduates one and five years after graduation.  
This analysis focuses on the migration experience of college graduates one year after graduation for three cohorts, graduates between 2010 and 2012, 2013 and 2015, and 2016 and 2018. </p>

For Colorado, between 77 and 83 percent of of college graduates are employed in the first year after graduation.
Among those students, between 73 and 76 percent remain in Colorado for at least one year.
