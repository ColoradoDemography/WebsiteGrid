<h3 class="h3_style">Introduction</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
Understanding the languages spoken in a community is relevant to many operations of state and local governments. 
Providing documents in multiple languages helps serve Coloradoâ€™s communities by providing legible ballots or by publishing program information in languages that specific communities can understand. 
Additionally, Federal Civil Rights legislation sets standards for multilingual documents that communities are encouraged to meet.

<h3 class="h3_style">Language Spoken at Home in Colorado</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
According to the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), approximately 84% of the population of Colorado reports speaking English at home. 
Among the 16% of people speaking another language, 11% of the total report speaking Spanish. 
The remaining 5% of people speak one of 42 other language categories listed in ACS Table B16001. 
These percentages are consistent over ten years of ACS 1-year data, from 2013 to 2019, and from 2021 to 2023, i.e., do not vary significantly from year to year. </p>

<p class="crosstext">
The number of people in Colorado who speak a language other than English is relatively small, approximately 890,000 out of 5.5 million residents.
The majority of those who speak another lanaguage at home report speaking Spanish.
</p>
<h3 class="h3_style">Ability to Speak English</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
Among persons who speak another language at home, 82% of Spanish speakers, and 88% of people who speak another language, report speaking English "Very Well" or "Well."  
Four percent of Spanish speakers and three percent of people who speak another langauge report not speaking English at all.  
Generally, a higher percentage of persons age 18 or older (i.e., those not in school) report not speaking English well or very well.
</p>
<h3 class="h3_style">Limitations of the ACS Language Data</h3>
<p class="crosstext">
The relatively small size of the population that reports not speaking English at home limits the amount of language detail the ACS can provide. 
This is especially true for people speak a language other than Spanish.
This being the case, determining whether the ACS is appropriate for an analysis requires an understanding of how this data is generated and the privacy policies 
that determine what the Census Bureau publishes. The SDO research brief discusses how the Census Bureau's privacy policies limit the language detail provided in ACS tabes.
