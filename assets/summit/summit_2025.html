<p class='summmittest'>
The Colorado Division of Real Estate does not issue Continuing Education Credits for hybrid meetings such as the State Demography Summit.  
Because of this, SDO is offering Continuing Education Credits only to Appraisers or Real Estate Brokers attending the Summit in person.  
We understand that this change will adversely impact Appraisers and Real Estate Brokers working outside of the Front Range Counties.  
We hope you understand the limitations of the Division of Real Estate’s policy.</p>
<p class='summittest'>Please contact the Division of Real Estate if you have any questions about this policy.</p>
